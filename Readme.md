Reflection:
2 hours of Googling can save you 10 minutes of reading documentation, as I learned in doing
this assignment. In the absence of a clear solution from either path, I took shortcuts that
work in confinement but can cause limitations later on. For example, I made a CSS class for
the 'col-3' bootstrap setting, which allowed me to easily target formating and styling for
the exclusive elements under that classification, namely; the nav bar elements. However, if I
were to continue developing this site and wanted to use 'col-3' for something else, I would run
into some obvious problems. This type of solution was implemented a few times throughout my
code, and though I did a few sweeps to reduce redundant code, I am sure that some remains. This
would mostly be contained to CSS, however, other design choices like the extensive use of
nested divs in html is an area where my code is efficient. This is because it simplifies CSS
and JS with broadly applied styling and functionality (through classes), rather than using
unique id's for a site with repetitive design.
