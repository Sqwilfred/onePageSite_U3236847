                        Extensive archaeological findings demonstrate that ancient humans had a well-structured approach 
                        to gathering and discarding their waste. In the Himalayas, excavations have revealed the early 
                        use of wheeled carts for transporting surplus woolly mammoth bones (wheeliebins.co.uk, 2013).

                        When humans began congregating in larger and more sophisticated settlements, from villages to towns 
                        to cities, the challenge to deal with all their waste production was dealt with at an increasing scale.

                        Around 400BC, the Ancient Romans introduced the world’s first municipal landfill. They were also 
                        pioneers in creating the first sanitation workers, tasked with hurling waste from the streets into 
                        horse-drawn carts. There is even evidence from digs at Pompeii that Romans used a crude form of 
                        wheelie bin for waste disposal, though not an effective vehicle for escaping pyroclastic clouds
                        (Davis, 2016; Machemer, 2020).

                        During the Early Modern Era (1500 AD to 1800 AD), as urban populations continued to swell with 
                        people living shoulder to shoulder, the need for systematic waste management became a necessity.  
                        In the cities and towns of medieval Europe, people often preferred to drink beer rather than 
                        river water, because there was so much garbage polluting them. Beer is still preferable to 
                        clean water.

                        If not for the smell alone, local authorities began collecting and disposing of rubbish on a 
                        grand scale, encouraging others to participate. Nevertheless, the invention of disposable items 
                        like tin cans, razor blades, and food packaging made the garbage piles bigger and bigger 
                        (JMac Property Services, 2017).

                        In modern times, authorities began distributing waste bins to households and organising routine, 
                        professional waste disposal services. The problem remained, however, that early bins were often 
                        bulky and difficult to carry to the street for pickup. Even the invention of a lightweight tin 
                        bin with handles was unsafe, causing more than a few back injuries.

                        That was until a rotten apple fell on someone’s head and they thought, “what if we take the wheel, a 
                        6000-year-old invention, and attach it to a bin?” Following this genius realisation, the modern plastic 
                        wheelie bin with a flip top lid emerged across Europe in the early 1960s and quickly earned its reputation 
                        around the world as the superior bin (wheeliebins.co.uk, 2013).

                        Alongside these advancements, automated side loader garbage trucks were invented with interior hydraulic 
                        rams to push and compact waste into the rear. This drastically increased load capacity, enabling trucks 
                        to empty hundreds of bins in single trips and transport their contents to modern waste facilities for 
                        processing (BigTruckRental, 2019; Encyclopedia.com, 2023).

                        While landfills remain a popular method of waste disposal, other methods include incineration, compaction, 
                        biogas generation, composting, and even vermicomposting, which is the process of using worms for the 
                        degradation of organic matter into nutrient rich manure (Britannica, 2023).
